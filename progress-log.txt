Can add artists to artists page, does not auto refresh

Have input set up for add album. API controller has a POST method, need to add a GET method to return it.
need to fix the albumsApi.js error, make sure @JSONIgnore is on the ablum.pojo (@OneToMany).

figure out why my delete method is not hitting.

in albums page, change the add an album to grid container of its own. and move ecerthing into columns.

Still need to add CSS to songs and songs.
